Eash directed curve stands for a leader-follower relation between two investors in investment events. \nThe self-loop of a node represents the sole-investment events, i.e. no followers.\nA node is larger (and green) when it has more followers. \nCooperation is frequent among clustered nodes and rare among seperated nodes.\n\nWe can easily a cluster of see foreign funds: IDG, Sequoia, Matrix Partners, while there is another cluster of funds with a government leader Shenzhen Capital Group.\n\nThere are more interesting insights waiting for us to explore.\n\nThis visualization is powered by Oxford Internet Institute.\n",
